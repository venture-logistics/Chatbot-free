# Frequently Asked Questions (AI Bot)

 How do I get started with this AI?
 Paste the embed snippet into your portal, upload your documents to S3, configure data-company-id, and your AI chat goes live in days.

 How does the AI learn our processes?
 It ingests all uploaded SOPs, policies, FAQs, and historical tickets. A nightly job updates embeddings so the AI answers with your exact terminology.

 Can we adjust the AI’s tone?
 Yes—use the Tone & Style Editor in the dashboard to choose formal, conversational, or any brand-specific voice.

 How do we monitor performance?
 Once enabled, the system logs every chat to Postgres. You can run Python scripts or connect Metabase to analyze volume, containment rate, response times, and low-confidence flags.

 What if the AI gives an incorrect answer?
 Any low-confidence response (below 0.7) is automatically flagged and emailed to your support team. Correcting that answer retrains the AI for future queries.

 Is it secure?
 All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, stored in your AWS region. We follow SOC 2 and ISO 27001 best practices; only your credentials have access to private data.

 Can we integrate more data sources in the future?
 Absolutely. Add new endpoints (CRM, ERP, BI dashboards) via REST or GraphQL. The AI will pull live data from all configured sources.
